# Get Ready To React - Workshop
This repo contains all the materials you need to follow our Workshop. It is created for the event [Get Ready To React](https://www.meetup.com/Thessaloniki-ReactJS-Meetup/events/240216476/), brought you by [Thessaloniki's ReactJS Meetup (Greece)](http://skgreactjs.com).

## Table of Contents
We will build a small ReactJS application which you will be able to complete step-by-step. The workshop will cover the following:

1. Build your first ReactJS application from scratch.
1. Learn how to structure your project with reusable components.
1. Make your app interactive with ReduxJS.
1. Add basic routing with React Router.
1. Find out how to test your components for free using snapshots.

## Who Is this Workshop For? 
We tried to make this workshop useful for many categories of developers. 

In order to fully understand the key concepts behind this tutorial you should be familiar with Javascript, HTML and CSS. In our examples we will use the ES6 syntax, such as modules and fat arrow functions. We will also use a variety of `npm` packages.

If you don't have any previous experience with the ReactJS ecosystem or if you are working with another framework, you will learn all the basics and you will be able to compare it with your current development environment.

If you are not a Javascript developer but you work with a different language, you will have the chance to meet something completely new. Maybe you should spend some time before/after the workshop to catch up the missing parts.

Already a ReactJS developer? You're free to participate making this Workshop even better.
